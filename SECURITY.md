### ‚úÖ EXISTING SECURITY STRENGTHS

1. **No Sensitive Data Exposure**
   - No API keys, passwords, or tokens in code
   - No environment variables exposed

2. **Safe Dependencies**
   - Using reputable CDNs (Google Fonts, Cloudflare)
   - No vulnerable JavaScript libraries

3. **HTTPS Enforcement**
   - GitHub Pages automatically provides SSL/TLS
   - Custom domain properly configured

4. **Static Site Security**
   - No server-side code = no server-side vulnerabilities
   - No database = no SQL injection risks

5. **Proper robots.txt and sitemap.xml**
   - No sensitive information disclosed
   - Proper SEO configuration

### ‚ö†Ô∏è LIMITATIONS (GitHub Pages Constraints)

1. **Custom Security Headers**
   - GitHub Pages doesn't support custom HTTP headers
   - Using meta tags as alternative (limited effectiveness)

2. **Content Security Policy**
   - Cannot implement strict CSP due to GitHub Pages limitations
   - Relying on browser security features

### üîç MONITORING RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Regular Updates**
   - Monitor Font Awesome CDN for security updates
   - Update integrity hashes when CDN versions change

2. **Dependency Monitoring**
   - Use GitHub Dependabot alerts (already enabled for public repos)
   - Monitor security advisories for used CDNs

3. **Access Monitoring**
   - Monitor GitHub repository access
   - Review any new collaborators or permissions

### üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY RATING: HIGH

- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Clickjacking attacks
- MIME type sniffing
- Information leakage via referrer headers
- Window.opener attacks
- Input validation bypasses
