Since you're using a custom domain, the `CNAME` file is already configured. For DNS setup:

```

Value: 185.199.108.153
Value: 185.199.109.153

Value: 185.199.111.153

Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: stephenjtyrrell.github.io
```

2. GitHub Pages will automatically detect your custom domain from the CNAME file
